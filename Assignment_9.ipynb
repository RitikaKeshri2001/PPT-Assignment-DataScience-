    "\n",
    "The batch size is the number of training examples that are used to update the model parameters during each training iteration. The batch size has a significant impact on the training process, and it can affect the accuracy, stability, and speed of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy: A larger batch size can lead to more accurate models. This is because the model has more data to learn from when the batch size is larger. However, a larger batch size can also lead to overfitting, which is a problem where the model learns the training data too well and does not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stability: A larger batch size can lead to more stable training. This is because the model is less likely to diverge during training when the batch size is larger. However, a larger batch size can also be more computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speed: A larger batch size can lead to faster training. This is because the model is updated more frequently when the batch size is larger. However, a larger batch size can also be more computationally expensive."
